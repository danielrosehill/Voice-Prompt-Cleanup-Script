Description: Audio preprocessing GUI for speech-to-text workflows
 Voice Prompt Cleanup is a GUI application that processes audio files
 to optimize them for speech-to-text (STT) workflows. It applies:
 .
  - Mono conversion and downsampling to 16kHz
  - Speech EQ (80Hz-8kHz bandpass filter)
  - Gentle compression for even dynamics
  - Silence truncation
  - Audio normalization
  - MP3 encoding
 .
 Features include batch processing, drag-and-drop support, and
 persistent output folder settings.
